## FusionAuth CLI

The FusionAuth CLI is a command line tool for interacting with FusionAuth. It is written in Typescript and is available as an NPM package.

## Requirements

* A modern version of node (tested on 19)
* A FusionAuth instance (download it here: https://fusionauth.io/download)

## Installation & usage

To install and use @fusionauth/cli, run the following commands:
```bash
npm i @fusionauth/cli;
npx fusionauth --help;
```

You can install it globally for ease of use from anywhere, but global installations can potentially lead to conflicts and are not recommended:
```bash
npm i -g @fusionauth/cli;
fusionauth --help;
```

Currently, the CLI supports the following commands:
- Emails
  - `fusionauth email:download` - Download a specific template or all email templates from a FusionAuth server.
  - `fusionauth email:duplicate` - Duplicate an email template locally.
  - `fusionauth email:html-to-text` - Convert HTML email templates to text, where the text template is missing.
  - `fusionauth email:upload` - Upload a specific template or all email templates to a FusionAuth server.
  - `fusionauth email:watch` - Watch the email template directory and upload changes to a FusionAuth server.
  - `fusionauth email:create` - Create a new email template locally.
- Lambdas
  - `fusionauth lambda:create` - Upload a lambda to a FusionAuth server.
  - `fusionauth lambda:delete` - Delete a lambda from a FusionAuth server.
  - `fusionauth lambda:retrieve` - Download a lambda from a FusionAuth server.
- Themes
  - `fusionauth theme:download` - Download a theme from a FusionAuth server.
  - `fusionauth theme:upload` - Upload a theme to a FusionAuth server.
  - `fusionauth theme:watch` - Watch a theme directory and upload changes to a FusionAuth server.

Instead of supplying the API key with the `-k` option on every command, you can set the `FUSIONAUTH_API_KEY` environment variable.
The same goes for the host URL option `-h`, which can be set with the `FUSIONAUTH_HOST` environment variable.
